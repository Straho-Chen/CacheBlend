full prefill generation: Brett, John, and Andrew discuss video games, specifically focusing on World of Warcraft (WoW) and a tank battle game. In WoW, players can be at different levels, and higher-level players cannot attack lower-level players.

Andrew recommends the Final Fantasy series as an alternative to WoW, describing it as an RPG where players play as a group of friends to resolve a crisis, with the last part involving avenging a destroyed kingdom.
